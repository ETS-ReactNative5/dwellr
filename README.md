# dwellr
Senior design project

Steps for running this code. 

1. First, download the code
2. Once the code has downloaded, navigate to the "dwellr-react-native" folder in your IDE (we used visual studio code )and run the following commands 
from the terminal

      I. "npm install" <br />
      II. "npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli"<br />
      III. "npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react"<br />
      IV. "amplify init"<br />
      V."amplify add auth"<br />
      
3. Upon running the amplify commands you will be prompted to setup the account information which requires the Access key, and secret access key.
We are unable to provide the keys due to security purposes. 
4. The final step among running successfully setting up the account information would be to run the command "expo start" from the terminal. This
uses Expo CLI to run the application. 
5. In order to run the ios simulator, you need to have xcode installed previously. After running "expo start", simply enter "i" into the terminal
to run the ios simulator. 
6. The ios application will now be running in the simulator and will perform as shown in the team's demonstration.
